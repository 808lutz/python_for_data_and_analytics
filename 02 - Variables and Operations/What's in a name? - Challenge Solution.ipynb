    "## What's in a (variable) name?\n",
    "Every programming language has its own preferred variable naming conventions and reserve words. Chapter 2 of the _Python 4 Everyone_ (CRS) book says that there are 33 reserved words in Python. A very literal programmer might try and name a variable storing the string `\"lambda\"` as `lambda` but will receive an error as shown in the cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "The challenge is simple. In most of the cells below, reserved words are used as variable names and they shouldn't be. In some of the cells, other illegal variable naming characters.<br>\n",
    "1. Change the variable names so that the cells execute without errors.\n",
    "2. Try other ways of re-naming the variables, such as camel-case. (Ex: Does `Lambda` give you an error?) Is changing the case (`lambda` vs `LAMBDA` vs `Lambda` etc.) a good programming practice?\n",
    "3. Get curious! The last cell contains an interactive verison of Jupyter notebook's `help()` function. If you're curious about the reserve words and why you can't use them or what to know what they actually do, try using this cell!\n",
    "\n",
    "Write comments or markdown cells as you go, especially for Step 2. This is a very simple challenge, but when programs get longer and more complicated you want to make sure you are using good variable names so that you don't forget what they mean!"
